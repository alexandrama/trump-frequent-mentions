		<h2>just another trump twitter analysis</h2>

		<p>This project explores the most frequently used words from <a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump" target="_blank">Donald Trump's Twitter account</a>. It aims to find the most frequently used words when Trump was tweeting as Republican candidate, president-elect and president.</p>

		<p>It is best viewed on desktop.</p>

		<p><h4>METHODOLOGY</h4></p>

		<p>I used a combination of R and Python packages to scrape the tweets from Twitter. I then divided the tweets into three timeframes: those written when Trump was candidate (from 6 Oct 2016 to 8 Nov 2016), president-elect (from 9 Nov 2016 to 20 Jan 2017 -- around the time Trump took the presidential oath, to be precise) and president (everything else up to 15 Mar 2017). This came up to about 1,080 tweets, or 160 days' worth of tweets.</p>

		<p>I then ran text mining and wordcloud programmes in R for my analysis.</p>

		<p><a href="https://github.com/alexandrama/scraping-twitter-for-mentions" target="_blank">Visit my "behind the scenes" GitHub repo to see the methodology, code and data in full</a>.</p>

		<p><h4>RESULTS</h4></p>

		<p>I found, unsurprisingly, that "Hillary" and "Clinton" were the most frequently mentioned words when Candidate was tweeting. Combative words and phrases like "drain the swamp", "Make America Great Again" (which were popular hashtags among Trump supporters), and "crook" also featured heavily.</p>

		<p>President-elect Trump took on a calmer tone as he embarked on his Thank You Tour. Neutral words like "thank", "state", "president" and "elect" featured heavily during this period. The word "us", surprisingly, was also used often, striking an inclusive tone.</p>

		<p>Familiar campaign buzzwords like "make", "America" and "great" featured heavily in President Trump's tweets. Mentions of important topic areas such as jobs and Trump's new frenemy, the media, also rocketed during this time frame.</p>

		<p>The word "will" featured heavily in tweets from Candidate, President-elect and President Trump, indicating perhaps that Trump (and his staff) regularly tweeted about future plans and ambitions. "Just" is also used quite frequently: a <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=just%20from%3Arealdonaldtrump&src=typd" target="_blank">cursory analysis</a> shows that the word is chiefly used to discuss information/news events that Trump had "just" figured out.</p>
